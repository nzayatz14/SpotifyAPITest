## Version 0.9.0

The past versions (<= 0.2.0) were just an initial test, hope nobody used it in production :) . I didn't had lot of time to make it pretty and working properly but now after lot of time I worked on this pod again, I made the code a bit less ugly and the layout working more reliably.  
See 0.9.0 as a beta of 1.0.0; The public APIs should not change from now to 1.0.0 while I didn't care about this from 0.2.0 to 0.9.0. If it works properly for you and you want to use it, do it. If you have troubles please open an issue.

## Installation
